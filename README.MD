```
sudo touch /Library/LaunchDaemons/crawler.plist
```

2. Add the following content to the file and save it:

```
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Crawler</key>
    <string>crawler.application</string>

    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/Users/alexei/dev/crawler</string>

    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/local/bin/node</string>
        <string>PATH_TO_THE_ROOT_FOLDER/index.js</string>
    </array>

    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>

    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>

</dict>
</plist>
```

3. Run `sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/crawler.plist` to start the daemon.
4. Run `sudo launchctl list` to check if the daemon is running.
5. Run `sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/crawler.plist` to stop the daemon. It will be restarted automatically on next boot.
6. If you want to completely remove the daemon, run `sudo launchctl remove /Library/LaunchDaemons/crawler.plist` or `sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/crawler.plist`.
